# Optimus Syria – Wind Energy Converter Development Project

Empowering a Sustainable Future for Syria through Innovation, Collaboration, and Engineering Excellence

Welcome to the official project dashboard of Optimus Syria – an interdisciplinary, student-led initiative uniting efforts from Hochschule Flensburg, Hochschule Kiel, and Damascus University.

This project aims to design, simulate, and prepare a scalable and locally adaptable Wind Energy Converter (WEC) specifically for deployment in Syria, based on regional wind conditions, economic feasibility, and market integration.

Over 15 specialized sub-teams are collaborating across disciplines, covering everything from aerodynamic design and structural simulation to electrical integration, control systems, grid compliance, and farm layout.

This dashboard provides:
- Weekly progress reports from each team
- A unified project timeline
- A live view of inter-team coordination and milestones

This site is maintained by the Project Coordination Team under the leadership of Bakhtyar Karimzade (Project Manager), with support from Josef Remberger (Deputy Project Manager) and Federico De Mita (System Integrator).
