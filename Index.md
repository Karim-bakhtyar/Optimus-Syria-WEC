# Optimus Syria – Wind Energy Converter Development Project

Empowering a Sustainable Future for Syria through Innovation, Collaboration, and Engineering Excellence

Welcome to the official project dashboard of Optimus Syria – an interdisciplinary, student-led initiative uniting minds and efforts from Hochschule Flensburg, Hochschule Kiel, and Damascus University.

This project aims to design, simulate, and prepare a scalable and locally adaptable Wind Energy Converter (WEC) specifically for deployment in Syria, taking into account technical feasibility, regional conditions, and market access.

Over the course of this journey, 15 specialized sub-teams are contributing to the full system development — from aerodynamic blade design and load simulations to drivetrain modeling, control systems, grid integration, and wind farm planning.

Through this platform, we provide:
- Transparent weekly progress reports from all sub-teams
- A unified timeline of development milestones
- An example of what interdisciplinary, international academic collaboration can achieve

The mission of Optimus Syria is more than academic — it is a step toward empowering local energy independence, fostering sustainable development, and inspiring the next generation of engineers and innovators.

This dashboard is maintained by the Project Coordination Team under the leadership of Bakhtyar Karimzade (Project Manager), with support from Josef Remberger (Deputy Project Manager) and Federico De Mita (System Integrator).
