<h2>Project Teams â€“ Optimus Syria (WS 2025/26)</h2>

<p>
The Optimus Syria project is organized into 15 engineering teams. Each team is responsible for a key subsystem of the wind energy converter, working from concept to final design and integration.
</p>

<p><b>Loads and Dynamics</b><br>
Team leader: Mohamed Reda Fawzy Ahmed Alywa<br>
Responsibility: Creates the OpenFAST simulation model, performs load case definition and calculation, and provides fatigue and extreme load data to all design teams.</p>

<p><b>Feedback Controller</b><br>
Team leader: Mirza Dincer<br>
Responsibility: Designs and tunes the dynamic feedback control system using ROSCO to regulate turbine behavior and mitigate structural loads.</p>

<p><b>Lidar Assisted Control</b><br>
Team leader: Hesham Mahmoud<br>
Responsibility: Implements LIDAR-based feedforward control strategies to anticipate wind changes and enhance pitch control responsiveness.</p>

<p><b>Rotor Blade Aerodynamics</b><br>
Team leader: Jay Atulbhai Pandya<br>
Responsibility: Designs the aerodynamic blade shape using QBlade, aiming for high efficiency, low noise, and balanced loading across the rotor span.</p>

<p><b>Rotor Blade Structures</b><br>
Team leader: Bhima Babu Masare<br>
Responsibility: Designs the internal composite structure of the rotor blades using NuMAD, focusing on load-bearing performance and manufacturability.</p>

<p><b>Electrical Drivetrain</b><br>
Team leader: Aiswarya Vijayan<br>
Responsibility: Develops the generator, converter, and transformer system, ensuring electrical compatibility, efficiency, and simulation under grid conditions.</p>

<p><b>Grid Code Development</b><br>
Team leader: Marcus Attalla<br>
Responsibility: Ensures the wind turbine complies with Syrian and international grid codes, including voltage, frequency, and fault handling behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Rotor Hub and Pitch System</b><br>
Team leader: Dhruvin Bhupatbhai Kakdiya<br>
Responsibility: Designs the rotor hub and pitch mechanism, including actuation, bearing selection, and integration with the drivetrain and blades.</p>

<p><b>Rotor Bearing System</b><br>
Team leader: Divyesh Sathishkumar Mistry<br>
Responsibility: Designs the main rotor bearing configuration, performs mechanical and fatigue analysis, and ensures secure load transfer to the drivetrain.</p>

<p><b>Gearbox, Brake, Coupling</b><br>
Team leader: Nehang Jitendra Joshi<br>
Responsibility: Develops the mechanical drivetrain including gearbox layout, mechanical brake system, and coupling to ensure efficient power transmission.</p>

<p><b>Machine Bed & Yaw System</b><br>
Team leader: Sathishkumar Venkatachalam<br>
Responsibility: Designs the machine bed to house the nacelle components and the yaw system that aligns the turbine with wind direction.</p>

<p><b>Tower</b><br>
Team leader: Ibrahim Mostafa<br>
Responsibility: Designs the tower structure to support the nacelle and rotor under all operational loads while considering transportation and installation constraints in Syria.</p>

<p><b>Foundation</b><br>
Team leader: Jehad Albaali<br>
Responsibility: Designs the wind turbine foundation based on local soil and climate data, ensuring structural safety and feasibility of construction.</p>

<p><b>Storage System</b><br>
Team leader: Farshid Montakhab<br>
Responsibility: Designs and integrates an energy storage system (e.g., battery) to improve grid compatibility and enable energy smoothing and support.</p>

<p><b>Wind Farm Development</b><br>
Team leader: Luis Urhahn<br>
Responsibility: Identifies the prototype site in Syria, evaluates site-specific constraints, and develops a full wind farm layout and infrastructure plan for installation.</p>
