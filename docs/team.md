<h2>Project Teams – Optimus Syria (WS 2025/26)</h2>

<p>The Optimus Syria project is divided into 15 specialized technical teams. Each team is responsible for a major subsystem of the wind energy converter and contributes to the design, simulation, integration, and final delivery of a grid-compatible onshore wind turbine tailored for Syria’s unique conditions.</p>
