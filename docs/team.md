<h2>Project Teams – Optimus Syria (WS 2025/26)</h2>

<p>The Optimus Syria project is divided into 15 specialized technical teams. Each team is responsible for a major subsystem of the wind energy converter and contributes to the design, simulation, integration, and final delivery of a grid-compatible onshore wind turbine tailored for Syria’s unique conditions.</p>

<h2>Project Teams – Optimus Syria (WS 2025/26)</h2>

<p>
The Optimus Syria project consists of 15 specialized engineering teams. Each team is responsible for developing and integrating a specific subsystem of the wind energy converter, ensuring a robust and optimized WEC suitable for Syrian environmental and technical conditions.
</p>

<h3>5. Rotor Blade Structures</h3>
<p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Bhima Babu Masare<br>
<strong>Responsibility:</strong> Designs the internal composite structure of the rotor blades using NuMAD, focusing on load-bearing performance and manufacturability.</p>

<h3>6. Electrical Drivetrain</h3>
<p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Aiswarya Vijayan<br>
<strong>Responsibility:</strong> Develops the generator, converter, and transformer system, ensuring electrical compatibility, efficiency, and simulation under grid conditions.</p>

<h3>7. Grid Code Development</h3>
<p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Marcus Attalla<br>
<strong>Responsibility:</strong> Ensures the wind turbine complies with Syrian and international grid codes, including voltage, frequency, and fault handling behaviors.</p>

<h3>8. Rotor Hub and Pitch System</h3>
<p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Dhruvin Bhupatbhai Kakdiya<br>
<strong>Responsibility:</strong> Designs the rotor hub and pitch mechanism, including actuation, bearing selection, and integration with the drivetrain and blades.</p>

<h3>9. Rotor Bearing System</h3>
<p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Divyesh Sathishkumar Mistry<br>
<strong>Responsibility:</strong> Designs the main rotor bearing configuration, performs mechanical and fatigue analysis, and ensures secure load transfer to the drivetrain.</p>

<h3>10. Gearbox, Brake, Coupling</h3>
<p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Nehang Jitendra Joshi<br>
<strong>Responsibility:</strong> Develops the mechanical drivetrain including gearbox layout, mechanical brake system, and coupling to ensure efficient power transmission.</p>

<h3>11. Machine Bed & Yaw System</h3>
<p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Sathishkumar Venkatachalam<br>
<strong>Responsibility:</strong> Designs the machine bed to house the nacelle components and the yaw system that aligns the turbine with wind direction.</p>

<h3>12. Tower</h3>
<p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Ibrahim Mostafa<br>
<strong>Responsibility:</strong> Designs the tower structure to support the nacelle and rotor under all operational loads while considering transportation and installation constraints in Syria.</p>

<h3>13. Foundation</h3>
<p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Jehad Albaali<br>
<strong>Responsibility:</strong> Designs the wind turbine foundation based on local soil and climate data, ensuring structural safety and feasibility of construction.</p>

<h3>14. Storage System</h3>
<p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Farshid Montakhab<br>
<strong>Responsibility:</strong> Designs and integrates an energy storage system (e.g., battery) to improve grid compatibility and enable energy smoothing and support.</p>

<h3>15. Wind Farm Development</h3>
<p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Luis Urhahn<br>
<strong>Responsibility:</strong> Identifies the prototype site in Syria, evaluates site-specific constraints, and develops a full wind farm layout and infrastructure plan for installation.</p>
